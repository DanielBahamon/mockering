			<p>Mockering prohibits the posting of content that incites dangerous or illegal activities that threaten personal injury or death.</p>
			<p>If you find content that violates this policy, please report it. For instructions on reporting violations of our Community Guidelines, please click here. If you find multiple videos or comments to report, you can report the account.</p>

			<ul>

				<li>Guided theft or cheating: show viewers how to steal tangible goods or promote dishonesty</li>

			</ul>
			<p>Remember, this is not a complete list.</p>

			<div class="collapse" id="collapseAgeRestricted">
			  <div class="card-body">
			    <p>When deciding to restrict age or remove content, we may consider the following factors. Remember, this is not a complete list.</p>
			    <ul>
			    	<li>Whether the behavior may cause serious injury or death</li>
			    	<li>Whether the individuals involved in the behavior are trained professionals to take preventive measures to prevent injuries.</li>
			    	<li>Can minors easily imitate behavior</li>
			    	<li>Whether the content can be used to commit serious violence</li>
			    	<li>The uploaded content is essentially educational, documentary, scientific or artistic work</li>
			    	<li>Are there any comments blocking the behavior</li>
			    	<li>Can the audience distinguish between true and false</li>
			    	<li>Whether the content promotes products containing drugs, nicotine or controlled substances</li>
			    </ul>
			    <b>Examples of age restricted content</b>
			    <ul>
			    	<li>Videos about false and harmful hoaxes look so real that viewers canâ€™t tell</li>
			    	<li>Video of reaction to dangerous challenge, no comment to stop the challenge</li>
			    	<li>Videos promoting cannabis dispensaries</li>
			    	<li>Watch the video of the nicotine e-liquid brand</li>
			    	<li>Provide guidance or promote cheating videos</li>
			    </ul>
			    <p>If it may be for educational, documentary, scientific or artistic (EDSA) purposes, we may allow videos describing dangerous behavior to be played. For example, news reports on the dangers of choking games are appropriate, but publishing clips from the context of the same documentary may not be appropriate.</p>
