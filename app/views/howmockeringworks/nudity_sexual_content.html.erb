			  <div class="card-body">
			    <p>If the content contains nudity or other pornographic content, but we do not describe any of the above, we may restrict its age. When determining whether to restrict age or delete content, we consider the following factors.</p>
			    <ul>
			    	<li>The focus of the film is breasts, buttocks or genitals (clothed or unclothed)</li>
			    	<li>Whether to depict the object in a posture that intentionally evokes the viewer</li>
			    	<li>Is the language used in the video a graphic language or an obscene language</li>
			    	<li>Does the subject's action in the video trigger sexual behavior, such as kissing, provocative dancing or caressing</li>
			    	<li>Whether clothing is generally unacceptable in public places (such as underwear)</li>
			    	<li>Whether the sexual image or audio is blurred, obscured or obscured</li>

			    <p>If the main purpose is education, documentary, scientific or artistic work, and not free, we allow nudity. For example, a documentary about breast cancer is appropriate, but it is not appropriate not to publish the clip in context to obtain sexual satisfaction from the same documentary. In aboriginal communities, during medical procedures, childbirth, artistic performances, or breastfeeding, nudity may not satisfy our record exception. Remember, providing context in the content, title and description will help us and your audience determine the main purpose of the video.</p>
