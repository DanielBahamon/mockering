			<p>We rely on members of the Mockering community to report content that they consider inappropriate. The content of the report is anonymous, so other users cannot know who made the report.</p>
			<p>After the content is reported, it will not be deleted automatically. The content of the report will be reviewed according to the following criteria:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Content that violates our <%= link_to 'community guidelines', howmockeringworks_path %> will be removed from Mockering.</li>
				<li>Content that may not be suitable for all young audiences is subject to <%= link_to 'age restrictions', age_restricted_howmockeringworks_path %>.</li>
