			<h2 class="_fw600">Violent content policies</h2>

			<br>
			<h3 class="_fw600">What these policies mean for you</h3>

				<li>Inciting others to commit violence against individuals or specific groups of people</li>
				<li>Fighting involving minors</li>
				<li>Video, audio or image involving traffic accidents, natural disasters, consequences of war, consequences of terrorist attacks, street fights, physical assaults, sexual assaults, self-immolations, torture, dead bodies, protests or riots, robberies, medical procedures or other similar situations with the intent to make viewers Shocked or disgusted</li>

			<a class="btn _btn_collapse_examples" data-toggle="collapse" href="#collapseRestrictedAge" role="button" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="collapseRestrictedAge">Age restricted content</a>
			<div class="collapse" id="collapseRestrictedAge">
			  <div class="card-body">
			    <p>If the content includes any of the above, we may set age restrictions instead of deleting the content, but will provide enough context to understand it. For example, content that shows that victims were injured in a major traffic accident may be deleted, but if news reports explaining the situation and background are provided, we may age-restrict the content. For educational content that contains violence, this context must appear in the image or audio of the video itself. You can learn more about the importance of context here.</p>
			    <p>We can also limit the age of fictional violence when fictional violence includes graphic scenes (such as a person being mutilated or beheaded) or scenes showing people suffering these serious injuries. Usually, when content or metadata tells us that the content is fictitious or is obvious from the content itself (such as animated content or video games), we will allow dramatic violence.</p>
			    <p>When determining whether to restrict age or delete content, we consider the following factors. Please note that this is not a complete list.</p>
			    <ul>
			    	<li>Whether the focus of the video is a violent image or a bloody image, such as focusing only on the most violent graphic part of a movie or video game</li>
			    	<li>Does the title, description, tag or other data indicate the intention to shock or disgust the viewer</li>
			    	<li>Whether the violent image or audio is blurred, obscured or obscured</li>
			    	<li>When the violent image or audio appeared in the content</li>
			    	<li>If the context allows the viewer to know that the image is dramatized or fictitious, such as in the video, title or description</li>
			    	<li>If the violence is part of a religious or cultural custom, and the audience is provided with this information</li>
			    </ul>
